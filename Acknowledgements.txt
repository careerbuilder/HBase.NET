This project uses apache thrift's thrift-0.11.0.exe in unison with hbase.thrift to autogenerate the low-level hbase thrift client. (see: http://archive.apache.org/dist/thrift/0.11.0/; http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/hbase/trunk/hbase-thrift/src/main/resources/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/thrift/)

This project uses apache thrift's thrift.dll to communicate with HBase. (see: http://wiki.apache.org/thrift/ThriftUsageCSharp)

This project uses Castle Dynamic Proxy (see: http://www.castleproject.org/projects/dynamicproxy/) to construct and intercept interfaces. Without Castle, returning proxies of interfaces would not have been possible.

This project heavily uses Rhino Mocks (see: http://hibernatingrhinos.com/open-source/rhino-mocks) in order to easily test the underlying functionality of the high-level client.
